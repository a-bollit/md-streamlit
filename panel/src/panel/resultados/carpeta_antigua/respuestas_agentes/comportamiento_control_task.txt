The logic and business rules within the EXPECA01 form ensure that notifications and their associated documents are correctly validated, processed, and issued while maintaining compliance with the specified business logic and constraints. The triggers, program units, and fields collectively enforce these rules and manage the various actions required for notification issuance.
